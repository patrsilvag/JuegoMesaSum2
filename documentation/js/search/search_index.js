(\\`.hbs\\` files): Handlebars templates for generating documentation pages\n- **Styles** (\\`.css\\` files): Stylesheets for customizing the appearance\n- **Scripts** (\\`.js\\` files): JavaScript files for additional functionality\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Extract this ZIP file to a directory on your system\n2. Use the \\`--templates\\` flag when running Compodoc to specify the path to your custom templates:\n\n   \\`\\`\\`bash\n   compodoc -p tsconfig.json --templates ./path/to/custom/templates/\n   \\`\\`\\`\n\n## Template Structure\n\n- \\`page.hbs\\` - Main page template\n- \\`partials/\\` - Directory containing partial templates\n- \\`styles/\\` - Directory containing CSS files\n- \\`js/\\` - Directory containing JavaScript files\n\n## Customization Tips\n\n1. **Templates**: Use Handlebars syntax to customize the HTML structure\n2. **Styles**: Modify CSS to change colors, fonts, layout, etc.\n3. **Scripts**: Add custom JavaScript functionality\n\n## Backup\n\nAlways keep a backup of your original templates before making changes.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more information about customizing Compodoc templates, visit:\nhttps://compodoc.app/guides/template-customization.html\n\nGenerated by Compodoc Template Playground\n`;\n  }\n\n  private downloadBlob(blob: Blob, filename:

personalizados.\n\n\nPruebas:\nKarma + Jasmine para pruebas unitarias. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}\n\n\n\n\nRequisitos Previos\nAntes de clonar y ejecutar el proyecto, asegúrate de tener instalado:\n\nNode.js (versión LTS recomendada).\nnpm (incluido con Node.js).\nAngular CLI:\n\nExample :npm install -g @angular/cli\n\n\n\n## Estructura del Proyecto\n\nLa aplicación sigue una arquitectura modular organizada principalmente en **páginas** (vistas) y **componentes compartidos**. A continuación se detalla el contenido de los directorios principales dentro de `src/app`:\n\n- **`core/`**: Contiene la lógica esencial y de única instancia, como los **guards** para proteger rutas (admin, usuarios).\n- **`pages/`**: Aquí se encuentran los componentes que actúan como \"vistas\" o páginas completas de la aplicación:\n  - **`admin/`**: Panel de gestión.\n  - **`home/`**: Página de inicio (Landing page).\n  - **`carrito/`**: Vista del resumen de compra.\n  - **`login/`, `registro/`, `recuperar/`**: Vistas de autenticación.\n  - **`categoria/`**: Exploración de productos.\n- **`shared/`**: Componentes visuales reutilizables que aparecen en múltiples partes de la app, como el  **navbar**, el **footer** y las notificaciones tipo **toast**.\n- **`assets/`**: Recursos estáticos, incluyendo las imágenes de las categorías de juegos.\n\n### Árbol de Directorios\n\n```text\n+---app\n|   +---core\n|   |   \\---guards\n|   +---pages\n|   |   +---admin\n|   |

  \\---toast\n|   \\---styles\n\\---assets\n    \\---img\n        \\---categorias\n\n## Pruebas\n\nLas pruebas unitarias se implementan en los archivos con extensión `*.spec.ts` y cubren principalmente:\n\n- **Creación básica** de componentes y servicios.\n- **Validaciones simples** de formularios reactivos.\n- **Comportamiento esperado** de métodos de lógica de negocio.\n\nPara ejecutar las pruebas, utiliza el comando:\n\n```bash\nng test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No
